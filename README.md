This was my first ever experience working with BackboneJS.

I took the pre-existing BackboneJS ToDo app from the TodoMVC page: http://todomvc.com/examples/backbone/

Then I added a few features to it:

1. Added a separate edit button to replace the double-click, which is not intuitive.
2. Added a 'priority' flag to each item which can be turned on to show urgency.
3. Added a new filter, *Priority* (aside from *Active* and *Completed*) which only shows priority items in the list.

That's it!
